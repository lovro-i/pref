## Mallows Model

Mallows model is an instance-based ranking model, which is a kind of Gaussian distribution for rankings, at least by its ubiquity in the world of preferences. It has two parameters: central ranking (s) and spread (?).


You can create a Mallows model object:
```java
MallowsModel model = new MallowsModel(items.getRandomRanking(), 0.3d);
```

And easily sample 5000 rankings from it:
```java
Sample<Ranking> mallowsSample = MallowsUtils.sample(model, 5000);
```


## Mixture of Mallows

Mixture of Mallows is a weighted set of Mallows models. It is represented by class `MallowsMixtureModel`.

```java
ItemSet items = new ItemSet(10);
MallowsModel model1 = new MallowsModel(items.getReferenceRanking(), 0.2);
MallowsModel model2 = new MallowsModel(items.getRandomRanking(), 0.5);
 
MallowsMixtureModel mix = new MallowsMixtureModel(items);
mix.add(model1, 0.3);
mix.add(model2, 0.7);
```
