## Mallows Model Reconstruction

If we have a sample of complete rankings, we can fit Mallows model (find the central ranking and spread) using `CompleteReconstructor`:

```java
MallowsReconstructor reconstructor = new CompleteReconstructor();
MallowsModel model = reconstructor.reconstruct(sample);
```

In case we have a sample of incomplete rankings or other preference sets, we have to use EM method to fit Mallows model. There are several different implementations, but you may want to go with `AMPxSReconstructor`:

```java
MallowsReconstructor reconstructor = new AMPxSReconstructor();
MallowsModel model = reconstructor.reconstruct(sample);
```

## Mixture of Mallows Reconstruction

We can reconstruct a Mixture of Mallows model from a sample of preference sets that belong to different Mallows models. We first use Affinity Propagation to separate users into clusters, and then fit Mallows models over each of these clusters.

```java
// Cluster the sample
PreferenceClusterer clusterer = new PreferenceClusterer(10); // no more than 10 clusters, may be less
PreferenceClusters clusters = clusterer.cluster(sample);

// Fit Mallows models over each of the clusters
MallowsMixtureReconstructor reconstructor = new AMPxSMixtureReconstructor();
MallowsMixtureModel model = reconstructor.model(clusters);
```
